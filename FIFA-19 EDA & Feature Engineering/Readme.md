# FIFA 19 Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering Project

This repository contains code and resources for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering project using the FIFA 19 dataset. The project aims to uncover insights into player attributes and team performance, and to engineer meaningful features for predictive modeling.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Dataset Source], comprising detailed player attributes, player performance statistics, and team data for FIFA 19.

## Files Overview
- `FIFA19 EDA, FeatureEngineering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing detailed exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, creating new features for predictive modeling of the FIFA 19 dataset.
- `Fifa.csv`:  Contains the FIFA 19 dataset in CSV format.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- **Data Exploration**: Detailed analysis of player attributes, team statistics, correlations, and distributions.
- **Visualizations**: Utilization of matplotlib and seaborn for creating visual representations of key insights.

## Feature Engineering
- **Feature Creation**: Engineered new features based on player attributes, positions, and match performance.
- **Data Transformation**: Transformations and enhancements of existing attributes for model inputs.

## Results and Insights
The project resulted in in-depth insights into player attributes' impact on overall player ratings and team performance. Feature engineering efforts have improved the dataset for subsequent predictive modeling tasks.
