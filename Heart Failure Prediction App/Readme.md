# Heart Failure Prediction App

This repository contains code for a machine learning-based Heart Failure Prediction app built using Python and Streamlit.

## Overview

The Heart Failure Prediction app utilizes a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart failure based on patient data. It provides users with an interface to input relevant medical parameters and receive a prediction regarding the probability of heart failure.

## Features

- Input Form: Allows users to input medical parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, serum creatinine, etc.
- Prediction: Provides a prediction regarding the likelihood of heart failure based on the input data.
- Visualizations: Displays interactive visualizations showcasing correlations between different parameters and their impact on heart failure prediction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Sourav1707/Heart-Failure-Prediction-App.git
2. cd Heart-Failure-Prediction-App

3. Install dependencies:
