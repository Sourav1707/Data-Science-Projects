# Fake News Detection 
This repository contains code and resources for a Fake News Detection system based on Logistic Regression. The project focuses on identifying fake news articles from a dataset using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 20,000+ labeled news articles, with fake and real news samples. It includes features such as text content, titles, and possibly metadata like author details or publishing sources.

## Implementation
The core implementation utilizes Logistic Regression, a popular classification algorithm, to train a model on the dataset. The process involves:

## Data Preprocessing: 
Tokenization, stop words removal, and vectorization of textual data.

## Feature Engineering: 
Creation of relevant features (word frequency, TF-IDF, etc.) for input into the Logistic Regression model.

## Model Training: 
Using Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest & Naive Bayes to learn patterns from the preprocessed features.

## Evaluation: 
Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
