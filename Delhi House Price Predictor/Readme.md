# Delhi House Price Prediction
The aim of this project to predict the price of the houses in Delhi, in various localities, based on the data present in the dataset. The dataset is from Kaggle. The project aims to predicts the house price, by analysing the features such as area, number of bedrooms, locality and many more. The dataset has 1259 rows and 11 columns.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset underwent preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the data for modeling. This included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering involved creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. For instance, extracting information from location data or creating interaction terms.

## Model Training
The model was trained using the preprocessed data. It involved selecting suitable algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating model performance using cross-validation techniques.

## Features
- Model: Random Forest Regression
- Features considered: Bedrooms, Area, Location, etc.
- Accuracy: 85% (R2 score)
